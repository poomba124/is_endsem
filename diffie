Agree on public parameters: p (prime) and g (base).

Both Alice and Bob generate their private keys a and b.

Both calculate their public keys A = g^a mod p and B = g^b mod p.

Exchange public keys A and B over the open channel.

Each computes the shared secret key: S = B^a mod p for Alice and S = A^b mod p for Bob.

Both end up with the same shared secret S that can be used for encryption.
